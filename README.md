## Introduction

This project showcases my personal portfolio website which I developed to demonstrate my skills and projects. During development, I performed a security assessment and discovered an SQL Injection vulnerability, which I then successfully mitigated.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python (Flask) or your back-end framework
- SQLite (or your database of choice).

## SQL Injection Vulnerability

### Discovery

During the security assessment, I identified an SQL Injection vulnerability in the login functionality. Deliberately,I leave the `login input` not clean and correct, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
For example, `admin'-- or 1=1`

<div <div align="center">

</div>

### Exploitation

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, I implemented prepared statements and parameterized queries below. This ensures that user input is properly sanitized and prevents SQL Injection attacks.

**Before Mitigation:**
```python
query = f"SELECT username FROM userData WHERE username = '{username}' and password ='{password}'"
cur.execute(query)
```
**After Mitigation:**
```python
query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = ? and password = ?"
cur.execute(query,(username,password))
```
## Lessons Learned
 - Importance of validating and sanitizing user inputs.
 - Implementation of secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection.
 - Hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating security issues in web applications.
